Gartner expects that [blockchain would produce $3.1 trillion](https://media.consensys.net/gartner-blockchain-will-deliver-3-1-trillion-dollars-in-value-by-2030-d32b79c4c560) in market value growing at a CAGR of **85.9%** from 2022 to 2030. While disruption from blockchain is more commonly associated with areas like payments and capital markets, the technology is eyeing a landing in the human resources space, which will inevitably change the way that HR professionals handle large amounts of sensitive employee data and deploy various HR processes.

One of the first challenges HR professionals face is understanding the fundamentals of what blockchain is and how it functions. Simply put, a blockchain is a distributed digital public ledger used to keep track of records. The term block is simply another word for the record. A blockchain, at its core, is simply a chain of records. Despite all the ways blockchain technology could potentially disrupt human resource management, HR teams need not panic. There is still some time to prepare for the coming blockchain revolution — and the technology has a strong track record of success in the industries it has touched so far. For example, banks can now [reduce infrastructure costs by 30% through blockchain solutions](https://coinjournal.net/accenture-blockchain-reduce-banks-infrastructure-costs/). This is achieved by encrypting millions of storage points, none of which contain a full name or an account number.

Rather than focusing on the intricacies of the technology itself, HR functions should consider the benefits blockchain delivers — such as trustworthy verification of counterparties’ identity without the involvement of a third-party — and then identify problems and areas of inefficiency in their existing operations that could be addressed through blockchain.

**SOMHAKO** is the first protocol-based, composable, and decentralized social graph uniting the entire HR industry. By indexing and syncing candidate data on the blockchain network, the Somhako protocol fuels the growth of the Somhako marketplace by providing different incentive mechanisms.

Developers can integrate the **Somhako Protocol** for importing existing Somhako networks. Developers may focus on providing a great user experience and leave growth hacking to the protocol! The Somhako protocol enables portability

Somhako is a decentralized platform that is designed to enable the open web of the future and power its HR community and economy.

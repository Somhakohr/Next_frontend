2021 was the year of a pandemic that has thought us the way we work, live, and socialize through various communities and platforms. A lesson to be learned and for generations to come. Guess this is the new norm

Likewise, if 2021 was the year that web3 became a buzzword, 2022 will be the year that the values behind Web3 start to make a lasting impact on the way we operate as a society. One such area that is ripe for change is the relationship people have with work.

Unlike the early internet and Web 2, both of which were owned and managed by centralized entities, the ownership and management of Web 3.0 data and platforms is de-centralized. This ‘powered by the people’ attribute of Web3 makes it not just a technology, but also progress in social ethnicities. Gartner predicts blockchain will create $3.1 trillion in business value by 2030

With great resignations all around the world, those who resigned will find different ways to meet their ends and many know and will not be looking for core values or culture in Web 3.0

### Some characteristics of Blockchain in HR

1. **Decentralized:** No single entity will control nodes and dictates any rules. All transactions are verified and approved. Each user will be responsible for developing and growing the community they are part of.
2. **Encryption:** Technology records data securely and semi-anonymously Participants can control their personal identity and other information, and share only what is required for a given transaction.
3. **Reward:** Value is exchanged in the form of tokens, which can represent a wide variety of asset types, including “money,” units of data, or a user’s identity.
4. **Distribution:** Blockchain participants are connected on a distributed network and operate “nodes” -computers that run a program to enforce the rules of the blockchain. Nodes also keep a full copy of the ledger, which updates independently when new transactions occur.
5. **Freelance economy:** In DAOs, work, decision-making, and financial transactions are decentralized and community-led.In Web3, earning is non-linear because freelancers will own part of the marketplace. Additionally, freelancers working for Web3 projects can earn a combination of stable coins and tokens, and those tokens can offer uncapped upside
6. **Immutability:** Completed transactions are cryptographically signed, time-stamped, and sequentially added to the ledger. Records can’t be changed unless all participants agree on the need to do so.
7. **Professional Development:** the learn-to-earn. Many existing Web 3 platforms offer great incentives as part of user acquisitions with a learning curve included. For example, exchanges or protocol uses token grants to both onboard new users and teach existing users about new features. These are part of investment in the community. In essence, these investments in their communities are a down payment on future growth and adoption of their networks.”
